# RemotePCDiagnostics

One Blazor app that diagnoses a Windows PC, usable on the bench or remotely by a technician who is somewhere else.

## Vision

RemotePCDiagnostics is a single Windows desktop application (a WPF or WinForms host running a Blazor UI in a WebView) made of diagnostic modules. The same UI runs in two ways:

- **Locally, on the bench.** The technician runs the app on the machine in front of them and uses it like any desktop tool.
- **Remotely.** The app runs on the customer's PC and is hosted through [RemoteBlazorWebView](https://github.com/budcribar/RemoteBlazorWebView). The technician, in a browser elsewhere, points at a server and sees and drives the exact same UI: seeing output, triggering scans and reading results.

## Planned diagnostic modules

| Module | What it shows | Data source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware inventory | Machine model and serial, CPU, RAM, board, OS version, uptime | osquery |
| Disk space and health | Drives, free space, disk models and serials | osquery |
| Services | Services that should be running but are not, exit codes | osquery |
| Installed software and patches | Programs, versions, publishers, installed updates | osquery |
| Network adapter errors | Per-adapter errors and drops, DHCP and DNS settings | osquery |
| System errors | Recent System event log errors | osquery |
| Application crashes | Crash records with exception codes and stack traces | osquery |
| Live temperatures and fans | CPU/GPU temperatures, fan speeds, voltages | LibreHardwareMonitor |
| Security baseline audit (optional) | Windows hardening checks against published baselines | HardeningKitty |

## Architecture (intended)

- One Blazor host app (WPF or WinForms with BlazorWebView), with one component per module.
- A small collector layer that wraps each data source behind a .NET interface, so modules do not depend on how data is gathered. osquery runs as a bundled process and returns JSON. LibreHardwareMonitor is used as a library, and HardeningKitty runs as a PowerShell module.
- RemoteBlazorWebView hosts the UI so a remote technician can drive it from a browser.
- Admin rights are needed for some modules (event logs, sensors).

## Licensing notes

Planned components are used under their own licenses and need to be confirmed before shipping: osquery (Apache-2.0 or GPL-2.0, used under Apache-2.0), LibreHardwareMonitor (MPL-2.0), HardeningKitty (MIT). This is not legal advice.

## Safety

Running diagnostics on a customer's PC remotely needs the customer's consent, a clear audit log and read-only operations by default.

Idea stage. This repository currently holds only this README.
